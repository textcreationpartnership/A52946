            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>The <hi>New Oath</hi> Examined, and found <hi>Guilty.</hi>
            </head>
            <lg>
               <l>SInce Oaths are Solemn, Serious Things,</l>
               <l>The beſt Security to Kings;</l>
               <l>And ſince we'ave all Allegiance ſwore</l>
               <l>To <hi>J</hi>— as King, or Succeſſor;</l>
               <l>I can't imagine, how we may</l>
               <l>Swear that or Fealty away.</l>
               <l>Nought ſure but Death or Reſignation</l>
               <l>Can free us from that Obligation.</l>
               <l>All Oaths are vain, both thoſe and theſe,</l>
               <l>If we may break 'em, as we pleaſe.</l>
               <l>And did I fairly ſwallow both,</l>
               <l>Who'de give a Farthing for my Oath?</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>If you affirm, as many do,</l>
               <l>They both conſiſtent are, and true.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>I ask, Can you Two Maſters ſerve,</l>
               <l>And never from your Duty ſwerve?</l>
               <l>Or can you <hi>True Allegiance</hi> bear</l>
               <l>To Two at once, and not forſwear?</l>
               <l>What's due to <hi>J</hi>— if <hi>W</hi>— have,</l>
               <l>And <hi>J</hi>— have what you <hi>W</hi>— gave?</l>
               <l>It's plain, you're falſe to both, and ſhou'd</l>
               <l>Or take no Oaths, or make 'em good,</l>
               <l>Which here you cannot, if you wou'd.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Nor will theſe Oaths, as ſome contend,</l>
               <l>To your own private Meaning bend.</l>
               <l>You ſwear to each as to a King,</l>
               <l>And ought to mean the ſelf ſame Thing.</l>
               <l>And 'tis Allegiance Full and <hi>True</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Is ſworn to both, to both as due.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>To ſay, The People have a Right</l>
               <l>Kings to depoſe, as they ſee fit,</l>
               <l>Is Pop'ry, or as bad as it.</l>
               <l>There is no Law, or Charter for't:</l>
               <l>Kings can't be try'd in any Court.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Bradſhaw</hi>'s <hi>High Court</hi> had but the Name</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Of Juſtice,</hi> and was <hi>Bradſhaw</hi>'s Shame.</l>
               <l>But that's by all condemn'd—</l>
               <l>Or he that dares ſuch Preſidents plead,</l>
               <l>Deſerves, like him, to loſe his Head,</l>
               <l>And hang for't, or alive or dead.</l>
               <l>Now to condemn the King untry'd,</l>
               <l>Seems ſomething worſe than <hi>Bradſhaw</hi> did.</l>
               <l>'Tis Engliſh Priviledge, to be heard</l>
               <l>Before the Judge can give Award.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>I know, ſome Conqueſt plead, and ſay,</l>
               <l>The King was driv'n and <hi>forc'd</hi> away.</l>
               <l>Convention though pleads Abdication,</l>
               <l>Becauſe <hi>unforc'd</hi> he left the Nation.</l>
               <l>Hard 'tis theſe Things to reconcile:</l>
               <l>He <hi>choſe</hi> to leave us '<hi>gainſt</hi> his <hi>Will.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Theſe Pleas and Proofs are oppoſite,</l>
               <l>And cannot both be True and Right:</l>
               <l>A Sign their Cauſe is deſperate,</l>
               <l>They'd ſomething ſay, but know not what,</l>
               <l>Their Non-agreement is enough</l>
               <l>To ſhew each Plea of theirs wants proof.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Now as for Conqueſt, Why ſhou'd we</l>
               <l>Make Slaves of People that are Free?</l>
               <l>Why ſhou'd we make ſo much ado</l>
               <l>'Bout what Prince ne'er pretended to?</l>
               <l>He from Convention took the Crown:</l>
               <l>Convention plac'd him in the Throne:</l>
               <l>Convention gave him all his Pow'r:</l>
               <l>Convention made the Oaths you ſwore.</l>
               <l>And therefore if to him we'de ſwear,</l>
               <l>'Tis as their High Commiſſioner.</l>
               <l>And if they have no Right to chuſe,</l>
               <l>We may Allegiance refuſe.</l>
               <l>We may and ought to keep't entire</l>
               <l>For Lawful King, and Lawful Heir.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>If People ſay, they have ſuch Right:</l>
               <l>They ought to ſhew how they came by't.</l>
               <l>If People made their Sov'reign Lord,</l>
               <l>They ought to ſhew it by Record.</l>
               <l>The Law o'th' Land ſays no ſuch Thing:</l>
               <l>By Law Succeſſion makes the King.</l>
               <l>They can't plead Scripture, if they wou'd;</l>
               <l>The Scripture ſays, <hi>All Pow'r's from God.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>God ſays himſelf, <hi>By me Kings Reign</hi>;</l>
               <l>'Tis he doth <hi>Higher Pow'ers Ordain.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>'Tis he doth make them all Supream;</l>
               <l>The People's Choice is People's Dream.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Nor can you prove by Law of Nature,</l>
               <l>That Princes are the People's Creature.</l>
               <l>'Tis plain, the People never gave</l>
               <l>What they ne're had, nor cou'd they have;</l>
               <l>I mean, the Power, which Princes bear:</l>
               <l>If People had it, make't appear,</l>
               <l>And tell us who, and when, and where.</l>
               <l>Our King has Pow'r o're Subjects Lives,</l>
               <l>By Law he takes away, or gives.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The Sword the People never bore,</l>
               <l>They ne're o're their own Lives had Pow'r,</l>
               <l>Self-Murder never was allow'd</l>
               <l>By Law of Nature, or of God.</l>
               <l>Wherefore the Pow'r which Kings have now.</l>
               <l>The People never cou'd beſtow.</l>
               <l>Indeed for Self-Defence to fight</l>
               <l>'Gainſt private Foes was Nature's Right.</l>
               <l>They ever had it, and ſtill have it,</l>
               <l>And therefore to their Prince ne're gave it.</l>
               <l>Beſides, the Magiſtrate's empowr'd</l>
               <l>In other caſes t'uſe the Sword.</l>
               <l>Though Vengeance is the Subject's Crime,</l>
               <l>It's very innocent in him.</l>
               <l>Vengeance belongs to God alone:</l>
               <l>Who has it not from God, has none.</l>
               <l>In ſtate of Nature People were</l>

               <l>The Laws which own our Kings Divine,</l>

               <l>The Laws, which make Allegiance due</l>
               <l>Without your Oaths, or theirs to you.</l>
               <l>The Laws, which give to ev'ry Man his own,</l>

               <l>Subjection were ev'en <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s due.</l>
               <l>He was Protector, (Name and Thing)</l>
               <l>He did th' whole Office of a King.</l>
               <l>No, 'tis a <hi>Right</hi> for to <hi>Protect</hi> us,</l>

               <l>(Whoſe will to govern is paſt doubt.)</l>
               <l>It is not Merit, but a Crime</l>
               <l>His People to Protect 'gainſt him.</l>
               <l>It is to keep him from his Right</l>
               <l>Who wou'd Protect us, if he might.</l>
               <l>It is to make himſelf Supreme,</l>
               <l>And to Protect himſelf, not them.</l>
               <l>It's to maintain his Uſurpation,</l>
               <l>And to entail on Captive Nation</l>
               <l>A laſting War, and Deſolation.</l>
               <l>And is this ſuch a mighty Favour,</l>
               <l>As to deſerve the Name of Saviour?</l>
               <l>For my part, I ſhou'd give him rather</l>
               <l>A harder Name than that of Father.</l>
               <l>And with the Cynick wiſh him gone,</l>
